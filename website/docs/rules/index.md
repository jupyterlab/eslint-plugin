# Rules

This section documents all rules currently provided by `eslint-plugin-jupyter`.

## Available rules

- [command-described-by](./command-described-by)
- [plugin-activation-args](./plugin-activation-args)
- [plugin-description](./plugin-description)

Each page includes intent, examples, configuration, and when to apply the rule.

## Recommended ruleset

The plugin ships with a recommended configuration that enables all current rules with the following defaults:

| Rule | Level |
| --- | --- |
| [jupyter/plugin-activation-args](./plugin-activation-args) | `error` |
| [jupyter/command-described-by](./command-described-by) | `warn` |
| [jupyter/plugin-description](./plugin-description) | `warn` |

These defaults are the same in both `jupyterPlugin.configs.recommended` (flat config) and `plugin:@jupyter/eslint-plugin/recommended-legacy`.

For guidance on using these recommended rules, see the [User Guide](../user-guide).
